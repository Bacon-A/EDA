# EDA
Exploratory Data analysis on the rock climbing data that I scraped.

This project is further explained in this blog [https://bacon-a.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/10/20/my-project-1.html.](https://bacon-a.github.io/stat386-projects/2022/11/16/EDA.html)

The Jupyter Notebook file "EDA" contains all the code shown in the blog.
